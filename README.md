# Fuzzy parking

The aim of the project is to create three different models for autonomous parking.

* Genetic algorythm
* Fuzzy sets
* Deep learning

Run the program
 ```
python main.py
```

genome_array holds genome for each car in the population. Each car genome holds information about neural network weights for each connection between neural layers.
